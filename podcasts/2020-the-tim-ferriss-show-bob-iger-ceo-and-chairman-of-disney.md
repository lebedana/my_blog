## What I like the most about the podcast:

* How simple BI is

## Notes and facts:

* Interesting insights about Jobs: he used to call Bob just to chat on regular basis, to ask about plans etc - as a normal human demanding contact with other human beings; Steve also made their relationships close enough really fast - normal thing was to give and receive honest thoughts and feedback \(no judging, no competition\)
* "Until you‚Äôre true to oneself you can‚Äôt be true to others."
* Bob prepares to cca 75% of meeting with new people  - mainly, to make the connection more personal 
* BI: "Where we talked about exercise, but one thing that strikes me there, I don‚Äôt think this is necessarily about creating more opportunities for luck, but I have found that oftentimes doors open on opportunity for people and not everybody is able to walk through them for a variety of reasons..."
* Leaders BI follows: Churchill
* ‚ÄúIf he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat.‚Äù

## Thoughts and Ideas:

* Acquisition of Pixar: Bob was very uncertain \(even in his position\) and unprepared on first meeting with Steve - very human-like behaviour, even a bit unprofessional. But nonetheless he succeeded. Was it because the acquisition was beneficial for both P & D? 
* üìë Even Bob does not manage his bookmarks well  - sending to email - reason? - no a good easy to use product? Conservative user? How peoples \(especially successful\) manage their bookmarks and notes?

## What related sources I've checked while listening:

* TODO: Routine of successful people 
* TODO: bookmarks management people experience 
* \*\*\*\*[**Ian Fleming**](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2565.Ian_Fleming?from_search=true&from_srp=true) **- ..** creating the character of James Bond and chronicling his adventures in twelve novels and nine short stories.

## Comment on podcast quality/style:

* Tim sounded more enthusiastic comparing to other recently listened episodes
* Still lacks empathy and ability to build a continuous communication

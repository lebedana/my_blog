# Partitioning

On disk/in data lake: 

* repartition\(5\) in memory, that `partitionBy` on disk
* from [artcl](https://mungingdata.com/apache-spark/partitionby/#:~:text=Spark%20writers%20allow%20for%20data,partitioned%20data%20lake%20is%20hard.) "In order to write data on disk properly, youâ€™ll almost always need to repartition the data in memory first."
* .option\("maxRecordsPerFile", 10\)
* Partitioned data lakes can be much faster to query \(when **filtering** on the partition keys\)

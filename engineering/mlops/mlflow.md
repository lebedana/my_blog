* [MLflow Tracking](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html): An **API** to log parameters, code, and results in machine learning experiments and compare them using an interactive **UI.**
* [MLflow Projects](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/projects.html): **A code packaging format** for reproducible runs using Conda and Docker, so you can share your ML code with others.
* [MLflow Models](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html): **A model packaging format** and tools that let you easily deploy the same model \(from any ML library\) to batch and real-time scoring on platforms such as Docker, Apache Spark, Azure ML and AWS SageMaker.
* [MLflow Model Registry](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/model-registry.html): A centralized **model store**, set of APIs, and UI, to collaboratively manage the full lifecycle of MLflow Models.

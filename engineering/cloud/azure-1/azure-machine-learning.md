# Azure Machine Learning

Azure ML workspace: 

* logical grouping of resources & artifacts 
* The workspace keeps a history of all training runs, including logs, metrics, output, and a snapshot of your scripts.
* Once you have a model you like, you register it with the workspace. You then use the registered model and scoring scripts to deploy to Azure Container Instances, Azure Kubernetes Service, or to a field-programmable gate array \(FPGA\) as a REST-based HTTP endpoint.

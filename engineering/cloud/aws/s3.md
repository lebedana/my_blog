* Only the owner of an Amazon S3 bucket can permanently delete a version.
* _Governance_ mode
  * user with specific permissions can change settings
* _Compliance_ mode 
  * use it if you never want any user, including the root user in your AWS account, to be able to delete the objects during a pre-defined retention period.

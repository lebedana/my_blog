## What I like the most about the book:

* Very honest, contains lessons learned on mistakes & misunderstanding
* Contains many stories about managing from Facebook, Google, Tweeter  

## Notes and Facts:

* Boss/manager = partner 
* Knew what drives/motivates each person in your team 
* Challenge directly and ask people to do the same 
* Practice radical candid "up", "down", "sideways"

### Radical Candor

* Can be applied outside of work as well 
* Give explanation to both prise and critics

### Obnoxious Aggression

* When criticising about caring
* Might be better than MI or RE - honest, team still is able to archive results 
* The worst kind of aggression happens when boss understands other person's vulnerability 
* Prise can be obnoxiously aggressive, too 

### Manipulative Insincerity 

* When you do not care to challenge directly 
* False apology 

### Ruinous Empathy

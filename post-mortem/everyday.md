# Everyday

### April 20-26

Multiple failures, mainly because of greater load \(cca 50h\):

* showing tiredness and almost complied to T. \(confirm being overworked is ok, say more that a sentence is not\)
* J asking if he could help - keep the circle; do not underestimate the gustier, it shows that we care about each other
* S - being too precise about small implementation details - my reaction reject, saying it is too small to solve \(corrected on spot to the write direction - listen, discuss, come together to a conclusion weather it needs to be solved immediately or can wait/do not need to be solved\) 
* Being too personal when discuss people \(With TK, with J\) - keep things professional, mind your business and things that matter

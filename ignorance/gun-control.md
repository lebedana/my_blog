* 300 million guns in the US right now \(population of USA 328.2 million \(2019\)\)
* that 42 percent of homes in America have guns
* extrapolated number - 2.5 million defensive gun uses in USA - asked 5000 people, got 1.3% = 66 people
* good guy has gun helps in 2/3 of cases; other methods all together in 1/2 cases
* about two thirds of America’s gun deaths are[ suic](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr64/nvsr64_02.pdf&sa=D&ust=1592771619202000)[ides](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr64/nvsr64_02.pdf&sa=D&ust=1592771619202000)
  * in the 1980s, a common method of suicide in Sri Lanka was swallowing certain pesticides, and after the country banned them[\[65\]](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vR92FoDxQGSq0EM5yTkpno5DCCYU6ZoE6KkE34TvzqaEYf7d77_w26jcGHdU52xjxP4HPnoQUduPZtm/pub#ftnt65) - the [total suicide rat](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/36/6/1235.full&sa=D&ust=1592771619206000)[e fell ](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/36/6/1235.full&sa=D&ust=1592771619206000)[by 50 percent](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/36/6/1235.full&sa=D&ust=1592771619207000)[\[66\]](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vR92FoDxQGSq0EM5yTkpno5DCCYU6ZoE6KkE34TvzqaEYf7d77_w26jcGHdU52xjxP4HPnoQUduPZtm/pub#ftnt66)….  Now, there was a minor increase in hangings.[\[67\]](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vR92FoDxQGSq0EM5yTkpno5DCCYU6ZoE6KkE34TvzqaEYf7d77_w26jcGHdU52xjxP4HPnoQUduPZtm/pub#ftnt67) But this didn’t come close to offsetting total number of lives saved
  * This has also been specifically seen with guns… In[ Australia](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2010/192/8/suicide-australia-meta-analysis-rates-and-methods-suicide-between-1988-and-2007&sa=D&ust=1592771619207000)...after a gunman killed 35 people in Tasmania in 1996... heavy gun restrictions were implemented. And once the bans kicked in, there was a[ slight increase in ](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2010/192/8/suicide-australia-meta-analysis-rates-and-methods-suicide-between-1988-and-2007&sa=D&ust=1592771619208000)hangings… BUT… the total [suicide rate droppe](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/compareyears/10/rate_of_all_gun_deaths_per_100_000_people&sa=D&ust=1592771619208000)d, for men it was by 8%.   
* in the [1980s …  when a bunch of US states](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article%3D1150%26context%3Dlaw_and_economics&sa=D&ust=1592771619218000) unintentionally set up a nice experiment
  * no credible evidence that the passage of right-to-carry laws decreases or increases violent crime
* From the mid-1990s crime rates plummeted around the developed world
  * two dozen of us mostly criminologists, really don’t have any good idea.
* Guns increase level of homicide = because the gun was in your house, there was 3 times the likelihood that someone would die

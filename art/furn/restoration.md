### Layered

* Lacquers, polyurethane \(varnish\) 
* Strong



#### Polyurethane

* Water vs oil based vs wipe-on poly 



#### Lacquers

* The easiest to apply 
* Nice idea to polish the last layer 
* New layer penetrates to previous layers



### Oiled

* Penetrates into wood
* Three types: tung, linseed and danish oil 



#### Tung oil 

* 4-5 coats
* more water resistent

#### Linseed oil 

* max two coats - more give no result 
* not very water resistent 

#### Danish oil 

* Mix of poly & tung or linseed oil

# Memories

### First memories 

It is summer - time to visit Bagajevka. Bagajevka is three hours up on the river Done from Rostov. We get there on "raketa" - a small cucamber-like boat. We walk to the destination for hours \(at lease, this is how I remember it\), caring backpacks with clothes and food.

The one-room-houses, as I remember them, were tiny. They smelled woody, old, and empty. There were two beds, a frige, a table, several chairs, and small cabinets next to each bed. When we were lucky, there were also chess desc and cards. When these were missing, I felt betrayed and lonely.

There were also shared spaces, such as a kitchen and a leisure room. I was terrified of the kitchen - there were always too many people, smells, and noises. But I loved the leisure room, because there was a billiard table. Mornings and afternoons we spend on the river Don. There were so many barzas, drifting the river back and force. Sometimes empty, sometimes fully loaded, they inhaled and exhaled water in the river over and over, making children, including me, incredibly excited.

During those days I felt happy. I also remember feeling independent, and joyful. I know that mama felt the same way.

\*\*\*\*[**Freshkills Park on Staten Island, New York** ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshkills_Park)\*\*\*\*

* On-going project, which will establish 3 times the size of Central Park recreation zone
* Its construction began in October 2008 and is slated to continue in phases for at least 30 years

**Ecology: What you as a person can do right now?**

* Minimize food waste/meet consumption/car usage 
* Be choosy about every-day helpers, like home tissue 
* Arrange/perform cleanups in the neighbourhood forests/fields 
* Check out local community for more 

**Electrical cars & energy in general** 

* There is around 80k stations across US 
* &lt; 1k are supercharging 
* Texas brings 1/4 of all US wind energy 
* Southwest of US has higher renewable energy potential
* Currently, wind makes up larger part of renewables than solar
* NG do not see potential in nuclear \(peak was 2007, than steep drop\)
* One flight produce more CO2 than one person in a year \(how much CO2 would produce 100-200 people traveling by car on an average distance?\)
* First hybrid \(gasoline engine and electric motor\) release at 2000 by Toyota. Tesla releases first car in 2008

  * World-wide agreement and goals 
    * [1987 Montreal Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal_Protocol) - designed to protect the ozone layer by phasing out the production of numerous substances that are responsible for ozone depletion.
    * [1997 Kyoto Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol) - commits state parties to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, based on the scientific consensus that \(part one\) global warming is occurring and \(part two\) it is extremely likely that human-made CO2 emissions have predominantly caused it.
    * [2015 Paris Climate Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement) - 195 nations agreed to cap global warming by 2 degrees celcius through emission cuts \(Trump announced US withdraw\)

ðŸŒ“ ðŸ”¥ ðŸš· 

**Climate change:**

* Plan to cap warming by 2degrees requires to cut down global emissions by half over the next few decades, and all the way to zero by 2070
* Extinctions rates today are hundred - for some gropes thousands - of times higher then they have been throughout most of geologic history 
* California's 2018 fires were the most destructive in the US history 
* Worst case scenario temp. grows more than 3 degrees Celsius on average. 
  * increasing rate of hard attack and other health- related problems caused by heat
  * increasing energy demand \(for cooling during the summer\)
  * In 2070, climate in Paris will be similar to current central Italy \(similar in CR\) 
  * In majority of Africa average temperature will be above 45 degree Celsius the whole year 
  * Increasing water demand 
  * Increased migration: poor/developing countries will not be able to adopt to increasing demand on infrastructure and cities capacity in general 
  * There are 67 cities climate will be unprecedented in 2070

  * enables live on planet at the first place - without the heating caused by the greenhouse effect, Earthâ€™s average surface temperature would be only about âˆ’18 Â°C
  * ..The atmosphere allows most of the visible light from the Sun to pass through and reach Earthâ€™s surface. As Earthâ€™s surface is heated by sunlight, it radiates part of this energy back toward space as infrared radiation. This radiation, unlike visible light, tends to be absorbed by the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, raising its temperature. The heated atmosphere in turn radiates infrared radiation back toward Earthâ€™s surface.. [source](https://www.britannica.com/science/greenhouse-effect)
